This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and is subject to the Evidence Software Lab's Apps Service Terms of Use. Your use of the Evidence Software Lab's Apps Service and any personal information you provide through the Evidence Software Lab's Apps Service are subject at all times to this Privacy Policy and the Evidence Software Lab's Apps Terms of Use.

    <h2>1. The Information Evidence Software Lab's Apps Collects:</h2>
    Information You Provide: You may provide to Evidence Software Lab's Apps certain information (often called "personally identifiable" information), such as your name, email address, credit card number, postal mailing address, and telephone numbers. You may provide us with this information if you use certain services or products from the Evidence Software Lab's Apps Service, enter contests or sweepstakes, or otherwise use the features and functionality of the Evidence Software Lab's Apps Service. Cookies and Automatically Collected Information: When you use the Evidence Software Lab's Apps Service, we and our service providers may send one or more cookies – small text files containing a string of alphanumeric characters – to your device. We may use both session cookies and persistent cookies. A session cookie disappears after you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains after you close your browser and may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the Evidence Software Lab's Apps Service. Please review your web browser “Help" file to learn the proper way to modify your cookie settings. Please note that if you delete, or choose not to accept, cookies from the Evidence Software Lab's Apps Service, you may not be able to utilize the features of the Evidence Software Lab's Apps Service to their fullest potential. Our service providers may collect information about your online activities over time and across different online services. One of the service providers that we use for data analytics is Google Analytics. If you do not want Google Analytics to collect and use information about your use of the Services, then you can install an opt-out in your web browser (https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/). Evidence Software Lab's Apps does not process or respond to web browsers’ “do not track” signals or other similar transmissions that indicate a request to disable online tracking of users who visit our web site or who otherwise use the Evidence Software Lab's Apps Service. We may also automatically record certain information from your device by using various types of technology, including “clear gifs" or “web beacons.” This automatically collected information may include your IP address or other device address or ID, web browser and/or device type, the web pages or sites that you visit just before or just after you use the Evidence Software Lab's Apps Service, the pages or other content you view or otherwise interact with on the Evidence Software Lab's Apps Service, and the dates and times that you visit, access, or use the Evidence Software Lab's Apps Service. We also may use these technologies to collect information regarding your interaction with email messages, such as whether you opened, clicked on, or forwarded a message. This information is gathered from all users, and may be connected with other information about you. Your User ID: Your User ID is displayed throughout the Evidence Software Lab's Apps Service and is therefore available to the public. Other people can see your feedback, ratings and associated comments, etc. Therefore, if you associate your actual name with your User ID, the people to whom you have revealed your name will be able to personally identify your activities on the Evidence Software Lab's Apps Service. Third Party Services: You may be able to link your account on the Evidence Software Lab's Apps Service or register on the Evidence Software Lab's Apps Service with an account you have with a third party service (“Third Party Account”), such as Facebook. If you connect or interact with us through a Third Party Account, we may receive information about you, including your Third Party Account profile information or your use of the Third Party Account, such as if you stream content through your account, as well as any other information you allow the Third Party Account to share with us. Please visit the privacy settings of your Third Party Account to learn about your options for limiting the information we receive from your Third Party Account. Third Party Web Beacons and Third Party Buttons: We may display third-party content on the Evidence Software Lab's Apps Service, including third-party advertising. Third-party content may use cookies, web beacons, or other mechanisms for obtaining data in connection with your viewing of the third party content on the Evidence Software Lab's Apps Service. Additionally, we may implement third party buttons (such as Facebook “like” or “share” buttons) that may function as web beacons even when you do not interact with the button. Information collected through third-party web beacons and buttons is collected directly by these third parties, not by Evidence Software Lab's Apps. Information collected by a third party in this manner is subject to that third party’s own data collection, use, and disclosure policies. Information from Other Sources: We may obtain information from third parties and sources other than the Evidence Software Lab's Apps Service, such as our partners and advertisers.

    Evidence Software Lab's Apps allows other companies, including third-party ad servers or ad networks, to serve advertisements within the Evidence Software Lab's Apps Service. These third-party ad servers or ad networks may use technology to send, directly to your browser, the advertisements that appear within the Evidence Software Lab's Apps Service and they automatically receive your IP Address and other log file information when this happens. Such third-party ad servers may also use other technologies (such as cookies, javascript, or web beacons) to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to personalize their advertising content. Evidence Software Lab's Apps does not provide your personally identifiable information to these third-party ad servers or ad networks without your consent. However, please note that if an advertiser asks Evidence Software Lab's Apps to show an advertisement to a certain audience or audience segment and you respond to that advertisement, the advertiser or ad-server may conclude that you fit the description of the audience that they were trying to reach. You should consult the respective privacy policies of these third-party ad servers or ad networks. This Privacy Policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, such other advertisers or web sites. Evidence Software Lab's Apps reserves the right to add or remove third-party ad networks or ad servers in its discretion and Evidence Software Lab's Apps may not at all times list such updated ad network or ad server partners in this Privacy Policy.

    <h2>11. What is GDPR?</h2>
    On 25 May 2018, the most significant piece of European data protection legislation to be introduced in 20 years will come into force. The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) replaces the 1995 EU Data Protection Directive. The GDPR strengthens the rights that individuals have regarding personal data relating to them and seeks to unify data protection laws across Europe, regardless of where that data is processed.
    <br><br>
    As a result of this change, many organizations that have access to and process the personal data of EU-based users are subject to the rules and regulations that come into effect along with GDPR. Since many of our customers are based in the EU & our company, Webcrumbz LTD, is headquartered in the EU, we need to address these rules and regulations accordingly.
    <br><br>
    In short, as an individual, you need to be able to get proper insights into what personal data of yours is processed by for instance Appticles, for what purpose and how. And you have the right to have old and irrelevant data deleted (“forgotten”) as well. So if you want your personal data removed from our systems, we must act on that request. This applies to every company that has EU customers or stores any other personal data of EU residents.

    <h2>12. What is Appticles doing to comply?</h2>
    At Appticles, we take privacy very seriously. Always have, and that is why we store and process as little details as we can to be able to work with/for you. You’ll rarely find us asking excessive details that we really don’t need for that.
    <br><br>
    As a general rule, do not give us personal data. Not your own, not your customers’ and not your visitors’. This may sound strange but for most things, we just do not need personal data. And under the GDPR, you should not give us personal data if it is not needed. If we do need personal data, we will ask first.
    <br><br>
    One of the things that we will be more strict on, for instance, is that we won’t accept people’s own personal login details. You’ll be amazed how many people simply send their own login details over email. This isn’t secure in any way, as you will understand.
    <br><br>
    With the GDPR, we need you to be in the driving seat in these cases. It’s your (customer’s/employee’s) data. You need to be able to control our access to your website, which means you need to create a login for your website especially for us, for the time of the assignment (so just to fix something in support, or for us to be able to configure our plugin). When that assignment is done, we will let you know and we’ll insist that you remove our login details as they are no longer needed. It’s your responsibility to remove these, as that isn’t something we can control. On our side, we will make sure to remove these login details from our records.
    <br><br>
    What are we doing to ensure data protection for all our customers? Appticles signup and login services are completed through a secure server (HTTPS/SSL). Appticles uses cryptography hash functions to protect your information. Your password is stored as a hash digest and, in the event of a security breach, your original password cannot be recovered from our servers. In accordance with the GDPR, site visitors have the right to access their data or "be forgotten" (to be permanently deleted from your databases). Right to access - click here for instructions. Right to be forgotten - click here for instructions. Setting up a Data Processing Agreement for third parties we work with. Updating our Terms of Service and other legal documents to align with any GDPR related changes. Reaching out to third parties we work with, to make sure these align with and are prepared for the GDPR as well.

    <h2>13. This is about personal data, not website data</h2>
    Please note, that most details we do have access to in our line of work, relate to website data, not personal data. The login details procedure as described in the previous section is especially needed in case of an online shop that stores customer data as well. As we want a solid procedure for this, we apply this procedure to all websites, just to make sure we and you are not overlooking that tiny piece of personal information you stored and made accessible for us by that login.
    <br><br>
    GDPR targets that personal data. Where it comes to website data: we need that data to further optimize your website. No personal data is needed for that, so please don’t make this data accessible to us. If you really have to, follow the procedure as described. Of course, we promise not to touch that data in any way that’s not agreed on. For instance, if we need to use the data for testing purposes, we’ll need to agree to this use in writing. And we’ll agree on what happens with that data after testing if needed.
